Flicks is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

##User Stories
1. User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
2. Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
3. The movie poster is available by appending the returned poster_path to https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342.
4. User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries listed on CocoaControls.

##Notes
I am having trouble with, getting the search bar to actually work and making the searchbar cancel when I press the (x) button and hide the keyboard. I added the fucntions yet it still does not work.
